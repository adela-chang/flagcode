Capture the Flag is a game meant to be played both in real life and on the mobile phone, taking multiplayer gaming to another level. Players join the game via their phones, and once the game begins, their phone acts as a radar which can detect the presence of enemies and show them the location/status of those on their team. Flags are virtual objects which can be carried and stolen just as in real games, with additional features such as virtual landmines which can be planted and “kill” a player in game.
